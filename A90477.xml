            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE Of the Late FIGHT BETWEEN THE French &amp; Confederate ARMIES.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces being Joyned, ſometime ſince, with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Troops, making in all, a Body of above Sixty Thouſand Men, Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, were drawn up very neer the <hi>French</hi> Army, under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> which lay Encamped in a very Secure Poſt; and 'tis ſuppoſed, might might intend to have declined a Pitcht-field, until <hi>Turenne,</hi> with the Forces lately Imployed in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> had Joyned them, had they not unexpectedly been Surprized into a Battel: The Manner whereof (after ſeveral various Reports-) is now ſound, and Confirmed to be thus:</p>
            <p>On the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Confederate Armies deſigning to paſs a River; a great Party of the <hi>French</hi> taking the Advantage, came, unexpectedly, forth of a Wood, and fell upon the Reer-Guard, conſiſting of about Nine, or Ten Regiments, for the moſt part <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> whereof the hindermoſt were thoſe of <hi>Holſtein</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Morber,</hi> and the Regiment of the Young Prince of <hi>Vandemont;</hi> All which, with ſome others, were Miſerably Shattered; and, for the moſt part, Cut to Pieces in the firſt Charge of the <hi>French</hi> Fury; So that the Remainder were forced to Flye: And that part of the Army that was gone over the Ford, made what haſte they could back again, to their Relief, the whole Army making Head as faſt as the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the place, which was very troubleſome, and uneven, would Permit.</p>
            <p>In This Defeat of the Rear, the Prince of <hi>ORANGE</hi>'S Carriages were Surprized, but as they were Carrying them off; A ſtrong Freſh Party of the Dutch came in, which after a ſharp diſpute, were compelled to retreat by a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſix Thouſand Horſe ſent in by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who in a very ſhort time were met by a Party of our Cavalry, and moſt furiouſly engaged, and now the Generals on either ſide drawing up with all poſſible ſpeed, and ſending Releifs to their reſpective Friends, the Groſs of both Armies came to a ſmart and moſt cruel En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, nothing of Courage or Reſolution being omitted on either hand: The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Troops breaking into and through each other, and the Generals often mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the common Soldiers of the Enemy; In which confuſion the Prince of

               <!-- PDF PAGE 30 -->
               <hi>Orange</hi> gave incomparable Teſtimonies of his Valour and Heroick Spirit, and the reſt of the Commanders inſpired with an example of ſuch undaunted Gallantry, ſeemed to brave all dangers, though ſeveral of them there unfortunately, yet glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fell, dying in Bed of Honour; The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and grand Officers of the other ſide, meeting them with an equal Bravery and Reſolution, ſo that the Prince himſelf had his Horſe thrice ſhot under him, and though at firſt it was reported he was near ſlain or wounded, yet we are now ſatisfied he came off unhurt though 'tis certainly affirmed, the brave Duke <hi>D' Engnin</hi> his Son received ſome wounds in the Face.</p>
            <p>The fight continued deſperately till mid night, and then after ſome intermiſſion, was renewed again the next morning, with as much Courage as ever: Both ſides acquitted themſelves with extraordinary Valour, but eſpecially the Imperial Infantry; Never did Fortune weigh the Iſſue of a Battel more Nicely; Nor could that of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> (where Fate Decided the Empire of the World) be bought with a more Sullen Obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>The firſt Attaque, began on <hi>Saturday,</hi> about eleven of the Clock, in the Fore-noon, and continued with all imaginable fury, and horror; except ſome little reſpit about midnight, till the ſame time-next day: at which time, both Parties wearied, but not ſatisfied, ſeperated from each other, the <hi>French</hi> Retreating to their Trenches; and though the Confederate Troops may boaſt themſelves to be left Maſters of the Field, yet they thought fit alſo, quickly to repair to their former Poſts.</p>
            <p>The ſlaughter in the whole, cannot but be very great, though as to the certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, common Fame ſpeaks very differently, according as the Intereſts, or Aſſertions, of the ſeveral Reporters run Byaſt to either Party. Some relating near twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in all ſlain, though more moderate Computers cannot allow of above half that Number, the Confederates Writing about four Thouſand on their ſide; and near twice as many of the <hi>French.</hi> But the <hi>Paris</hi> Letters ſpeak juſt contrary, though moſt certain it is, abundance of the Flower of the <hi>French</hi> Gentry, (ſome affirm near four Hundred) ſpurred on by an exceſs of Gallantry Sacrificed here their lives to Honour. The Account of Perſons of extraordinary Quality, ſtands thus.</p>
